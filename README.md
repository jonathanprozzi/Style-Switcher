# Style-Switcher
Quick Style-Switching with JavaScript. Written as a project example for DHF Web Development with JavaScript course.

Check out the GitHub pages link for a live demo: http://jonathanprozzi.github.io/Style-Switcher/

## Activity Notes:
Some of the JavaScript may be unfamiliar, but this is a good way to learn! There are comments to help you understand the general idea, but you should use the code as a guide and then lookup anything that you're unsure of. Use the MDN, it's a great resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

Have fun!
